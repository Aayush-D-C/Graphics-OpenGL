## About the Repository
This repository is divided into three main sections:
1. **Algorithm Programs**: Contains implementations of various algorithms in a structured and easy-to-understand format.
2. **Graphics Programming**: Includes theoretical and practical resources for understanding computer graphics, focusing on traditional algorithms like DDA, Bresenham's, and Midpoint.
3. **OpenGL Knowledge**: Provides comprehensive insights into OpenGL concepts, including shaders and advanced graphics techniques.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone this repository to your local machine using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
```
Ensure you have the necessary development tools installed to run the programs and examples. For OpenGL programs, you may need additional libraries like `GLFW`, `GLEW`, or `GLUT`.

## Graphics Programming
This section includes resources and examples related to traditional computer graphics algorithms and the usage of `graphics.h`.

### Traditional Computer Graphics Algorithms
- **DDA Algorithm**: Implementation of the Digital Differential Analyzer algorithm for line drawing.
- **Bresenham's Line Algorithm**: Efficient line drawing algorithm with integer arithmetic.
- **Midpoint Circle Algorithm**: Algorithm to draw circles using incremental integer calculations.
- **Polygon Filling Algorithms**: Algorithms like Scanline and Boundary Fill.

### Graphics.h
The `graphics.h` library is a simple and widely used library for implementing 2D graphics in C/C++. This section includes:
- Setting up `graphics.h` on modern systems.
- Drawing primitives (lines, circles, rectangles, etc.).
- Applying transformations (translation, scaling, rotation).

## OpenGL Knowledge
This section provides resources and programs for understanding and working with OpenGL.

### Basics of Graphics Programming
- Coordinate Systems
- Transformation (Translation, Rotation, Scaling)
- Basics of Rendering

### OpenGL Essentials
- Setting up an OpenGL environment
- Understanding the OpenGL pipeline
- Working with shaders (Vertex and Fragment Shaders)
- Handling Buffers (VBO, VAO, and EBO)
